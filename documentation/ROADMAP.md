# __Genie Bot ROAD MAP ðŸ›¤__

## __Bot implementation objectives:__

---

- [x] Genie can query almost any question or statement using the Wolfram's API

- [x] Genie can show the latest day picture from the NASA's feed
  
- [x] Genie can show the 5 latest news from the NASA's feed

- [x] The project passes the Rspec tests

### __Fixes after the project's review__

- [x] Please add the Ruby version you are using in the documentation or a .ruby-version file in the root of your project.
  - _Version file is now present in te root and README_

- [x] The step, in the doc, to generate the app key was difficult to find so I suggest you to add a link or a path to reach it out- In the steps you use a gif to show the different commands we can use I suggest you put an additional text with the command so we don't need to check all the gif.
  - _Extra resources are now available in the documentation folder_

- [x] About your commits, the idea is that they tell the story about how you are building your app so it is better so create each commit describing the feature you are developing now instead of including several tasks in your one commit.

## _Solutions according to the feedback_

---

In order to keep a track of the possible improvements to apply and to succesfully solve the major of the struggling points of the project, the creation of this road map and the documentation folder was a handy tool.

Any further issue will be documented here and in the corresponding documentation file.
